(c) L. Holm 1993-2007

is granted to ....................................

in exchange for the following commitments:

I hereby certify that

        (1) I am an academic user at an academic research institution. In
            using the software, We will respect the interests of the authors
            and their institutions.

        (2) I will not use the software in commercial activities without
            a written commercial licence agreement; commercial activities
            include, in particular, work under contract from a commercial
            company.

        (3) I will not redistribute the software to others outside of my
            immediate research group. I will suggest to other interested
            research groups to contact the authors directly. When I leave
            my current institution, I will either delete the software or
            reapply for a new licence.

        (4) I will not alter or suppress the run-time copyright message.

        (5) I will acknowledge the program authors on any publication of
            scientific results based in part on use of the program and
            cite the article in which the program was described (Holm,L. &
            Sander,C. 1996 "Mapping the protein universe", Science 273,
            595-602).

        (6) I will report evidence of program bugs to the authors.

        (7) I will send the source code of any bug corrections and program
            extensions, major or minor, to the original authors, for free
            academic use. If I have made major extensions which are incor-
            porated by the authors, I reserve the right to be appropriately
            included in any future commercial licence agreement.

        (8) I will not extract part of the software, e.g. modules or sub-
            routines, for use in other contexts without permission by the
            authors.

        (9) I will not use the program in the context of classified research.
