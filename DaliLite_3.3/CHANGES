==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.3.3 (Feb 2010)
==============================================================================

Bin/walk.pl
===========
Improved search which updates the best route to a second neighbour on the fly.

==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.3.2 (Oct 2008)
==============================================================================

DaliLite
========
Obsolete code (-search option) was removed.

Obsolete 'sort +1' syntax changed to 'sort -k 2'

Bin/util.f
==========
Bug fix to read MSE residues consistently in PDB & DSSP.

==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.3.1 (Feb 2008)
==============================================================================

DaliLite
========
Corrected bug in reading x,y,z coordinates less than -99.999 in structure 
superimposition by -pairwise option.

==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.3.0 (Feb 2008)
==============================================================================

Bin/util.f
==========
Moved function constructfilnam here from multiple sources.

Bin/sortdccp.pl
===============
Added optional argument <nkeep> to remove all but nkeep best alignments per 
cd1-cd2.

Bin/pipe96.pl
=============
Modified to let through only Nbest comparisons per cd1cd2 pair with zscore above
cutoff. (Previously at least Nbest comparisons and all above zscore cutoff.)

DaliLite
========
Arguments to pipe96.pl changed from Nbest=10 to Nbest=1 (see above).

Bin/parsi-admin.f
=================
Changed lfirstonly to .true. in call to main(). This means that only one 
optimal alignment is returned rather than 10 best alignments. Symmetrical
structures like TIM barrels may get worse scores than before.

Bin/wolf
========
New programs wolf-grid, wolf-dbsearch 

==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.2.4.5 (20 Dec 2007)
==============================================================================

Bin/DaliLite
============

The environment variable DALI_DATA_HOME is introduced in the script DaliLite. 
It allows to have the data and executables located in different places. 
The variable DALI_SERVER_HOME now concerns only the executables. If unset, 
DALI_DATA_HOME defaults to current directory. To modify the default value, 
adjust directly in the script DaliLite.

The value of DALI_SERVER_HOME, if unset in the environment, must be
adjusted directly in the DaliLite script or, as in previous releases, 
by setting appropriately the variable $HOMEDIR in the Makefile and 
proceeding to "make install". In order to have DALI_SERVER_HOME defaulting 
to the current directory, adjust the DaliLite script.

Bin/parsizes-puutos.f, Bin/parsizes.for
=======================================

- increased exdim parameter from 300000 to 350000

See Changes v.2.4.4 below for comments on the above increase for exdim.

==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.2.4.4 (15 Jan 2007)
==============================================================================

Many parameter increases in this new release. Segfaults were occurring with
pdb files containing many chains, large chains, or many structure segments.
These are patches only - they still need to be handled correctly! Watch
this space...

Bin/parsizes-puutos.f
=====================
- increased maxres parameter from 6000 to 12000 to allow for pdb entries
  with a large number of chains
- increased exdim parameter from 200000 to 300000

Bin/parsizes.for, Bin/util.f, Bin/parsi-admin.f
===============================================
- changed maxseg parameter from 80 to 200, as -align mode was failing
  for a few large pdb entries, containing many secondary elements
- increased exdim parameter from 200000 to 300000

Bin/parsizes.for
================
- increased exdim parameter from 120000 to 300000 because of out-of-bounds
  array segfaults (this is a patch - still needs to be properly handled!)

Bin/gagasizes.for
=================
- maxres and maxres0 parameters increased to 5000

Bin/parsi-align.f
=================
- hidden maxseg=80 increased to 200


==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.2.4.3 (19 Dec 2006)
==============================================================================

Makefile
========
- altered test and clean targets in Makefile - they weren't working properly
  if directories were missing (as was accidentally the case in release 2.4.2)
  Targets are now test1 and test2, as are corresponding output directories.


==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.2.4.2 (01 May 2006)
==============================================================================
Makefile
========
- add warning that the maximum length of HOMEDIR is 70 characters

==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.2.4.1 (01 Mar 2005)
==============================================================================

DaliLite
========
- default for DALI_SERVER_HOME is now value of env $PWD, in case 'make all'
  is used instead of 'make install'. Note that 'make install' will still
  override this default, as will having env $DALI_SERVER_HOME set.

Makefile, Makefile_cygwin
=========================
- default Makefile is now for linux. Cygwin users should rename
  Makefile_cygwin to Makefile.
- for consistency and clarity, variable 'perlhomedir' renamed to
  'ESCAPED_HOMEDIR'.
- removed unnecessary escaped separator ('\/') from line49 where
  ESCAPED_HOMEDIR is used, as this was making pathnames untidy,
  eg '/home/you/DaliLite_2.4//Bin/puu'.

INSTALL
=======
- minor update to reflect changes in Makefiles and DaliLite main script.


==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.2.4 (16 Dec 2004)
==============================================================================

DaliLite
========
- renamed links in -pairwise HTML output page
- checking length of input PDB file name, which is hardcoded as 80 in puu.f

Makefile
========
- install converts DOS newlines to Unix: perl -pe 's/\015\012/\012/g'

fssp.f
======
- made independent of DSSP

gagatool.f, seqfitz.f
=====================
- readdssp1 was never called 

==============================================================================
Changes in DaliLite v.2.3 (30 Aug 2004)
==============================================================================

Makefile
========
- replaces old Fortran program compiler script 
	make install	# installation
	make all	# re-compilation
	make test	# testing DaliLite -pairwise 
	make test1	# testing 'advanced' DaliLite options

	make clean
	make clean_test
	make clean_test1
	
util.f
======
- new file, collecting subroutines or functions used by many programs
	subroutine getdssp
		not reading nhb, nhbp any more
		strictly requires dsspcmbi (wide format)

 		MSD reported problem in reading lines with h-bond partners,
			but presumably it has gone away with DSSPcmbi

	subroutine getcoor 
		not reading bvalue any more

puu.f
=====
- changed arguments to call getdssp from util.f
- changed arguments to call getcoor

puutos.f
========
- changed arguments to call getdssp from util.f

seqfitz.f
=========
- changed arguments to call getdssp from util.f

fssp.f
======
- changed arguments to call getdssp from util.f

gagatool.f
==========
- changed arguments to call getdssp from util.f

dp.f
====
- read absolute value (MSD)
	write(*,601) 'DCCP   1 ',score,rmsd,abs(lali),

DaliLite
========
- corrected typo $DALI_SERVER_HOMEy/Bin/replace
- 'make install' sets $DALI_SERVER_HOME in DaliLite script
	original copy is $DALI_SERVER_HOME/Bin/DaliLite
	customised version is SDALI_SERVER_HOME/DaliLite

corescore.f
===========
- corescore was disabled in DaliLite, file deleted!

replace.f
=========
- list0(maxprot), maxprot set in parsizes.for to have space for all of PDB

include files
================
- parsizes.for
	increased dimensions as suggested by MSD, except maxprot=100000
	
- parsizes-puutos.for
	increased maxprot=100000
	
- gagasizes.for
	(this is the include file for the dalicon program)

	dalicon crashes if increase dimensions as suggested by MSD, therefore
		using the old dimensions
	
	maxdom occurs in gagatool.f: node_type(maxdom)

==============================================================================
